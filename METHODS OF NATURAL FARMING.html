            Tilling or digging the soil always destroys soil structure, soil
            water holding capacity, soil organic matter, soil biodiversity, and
            soil health. Tillage overturns the soil layers and exposes the lower
            soil to sun and air which destroys soil organic matter by oxidation
            and kills the soil microorganisms (fungi and bacteria) and other
            organisms (earthworms) by sun drying. As the living components of
            soil (plants, animals, and microorganisms) are responsible for soil
            health, the destruction of soil organisms and their habitats
            destroys soil health and makes the soil dead. Therefore, avoiding
            tillage (no-till) is always helpful for preserving soil structure,
            soil organic matter, soil biodiversity, and soil health. However, in
            natural farming agroecosystems, earthworms do the soil turning most
            efficiently without disturbing the soil structure, soil mulching, or
            soil moisture.

            Natural farming agroecosystems are completely self-sufficient and
            self-reliant in crop production and crop protection. It restores the
            natural biogeophysical cycles (such as soil temperature cycle and
            soil water cycle) and biogeochemical cycles (such as carbon cycle,
            nitrogen cycle, phosphorus cycle, and potassium cycle) to maintain
            soil health, plant health, animal health, human health, and
            environment health in their best conditions. Therefore there is no
            need for application of any external inputs in natural farming for
            maximising crop production. Moreover, the application of chemical
            fertilizers or bio-fertilizers disturbs the functioning of native
            microorganism biodiversity in soil (Game Theory). Natural farming
            agroecosystems maintain a carefully planned biodiversity of plants,
            animals, and microorganisms that automatically maintains natural
            control among the populations of insect pests, predators, parasites,
            diseases, antagonists, and weeds in crops. Application of
            pesticides, biopesticides, fungicides, antibiotics, and herbicides
            disturb this ecological balance and develop resistance against these
            pesticides to cause more severe epidemics on crops. Therefore
            avoiding all sorts of external inputs is beneficial for both crop
            production and crop protection in natural farming. Elimination of
            external inputs also reduces the cost of production of crops
            significantly and helps to maximize crop yield, crop quality, and
            profit for the farmers. This is why natural farming is also known as
            zero-budget natural farming (ZBNF) or do-nothing agriculture.

            About 10,000 years ago, indigenous people started plant
            domestication and plant breeding all over the world to ensure the
            supply of food close to their settlements. They have domesticated
            more than 7,000 plant species and have developed thousands of unique
            plant varieties that made agriculture sustainable and resilient for
            thousands of years. 
            <br><br>The indigenous method of plant breeding includes
            <br><br>
            (1) collection of better plant genotypes and their wild relatives
            from other farmers or wild sources,
            <br><br> 
            (2) conservation of these plant
            genotypes in decentralized seed banks (now known as Vavilov
            Centres),
            <br><br> 
            (3) facilitating random open pollination of these
            genotypes through biotic (such as native pollinator biodiversity)
            and abiotic factors (such as wind) to achieve natural hybridization
            of crops,
            <br><br> 
            (4) facilitating mutation and somatic mutation of the
            genotypes,
            <br><br> 
            (5) characterization and selection of new elite genotypes
            by the actual farmers according to their own need and preference,
            <br><br>
            (6) preservation of seed in special containers,
            <br><br>
            (7) seed exchange(free of cost),
            <br><br> 
            (8) seed diffusion,
            <br><br>
            (9) seed migration and finally
            <br><br>
            (10) naming the plant varieties based on their useful characters.
            This traditional system of plant breeding follows a complete cycle
            of continuous improvements of plant varieties in their place of
            origin as well as in their place of adoption. Natural farming
            agroecosystems should follow this traditional system of plant

            Laying out dry leaves or other organic materials over the soil
            surface and maintaining them throughout the year is known as
            mulching. Mulching provides several regulating ecosystem services.
            Mulching protects the soil from soil erosion caused by sun, rain,
            and wind, helps with rainwater harvesting, reduces runoff, moderates
            soil temperature, reduces the rate of evapotranspiration from the

            Mixed cropping of multiple crops and stacking them in multiple
            layers of canopies are known as multilayer poly cropping. The number
            of crops can range from 3 (Three Sisters) to 256 (Forest Garden) and
            the canopy layers can range from 5 (ZBNF) to 7 (Food Forest).
            Multilayer poly cropping gives a natural farming agroecosystem the
            structure and function of a natural forest ecosystem. Multilayer
            polycropping can harvest maximum sunlight and rainwater, provide
            habitat to maximum animal biodiversity, can maximise crop yield,
            crop quality, crop diversity, and farmers' income. The following
            steps should be followed to establish an ideal multilayer poly
            cropping system:

            <br /><br />

            <strong>1. plant rating and ranking -</strong>
            crop species and cultivars are evaluated based on the valuation of
            their ecosystem services to assign them a rating and rank them to
            prepare a priority list of the best crop varieties for each natural
            farm. The plant varieties are evaluated based on various economic
            and ecological parameters. Economic parameters are crop yield,
            marketable qualities of the crop, the season of harvesting, the
            price of the crop, and market size (price x volume). The ecological
            parameters are plant height, spacing, canopy density, provision for
            food and habitat for animal biodiversity (particularly pollinators,
            insect predators, parasitoids, and birds), inducing cloud and
            rainfall, fixing atmospheric nitrogen in symbiotic association with
            bacteria, resistance or tolerance against biotic and abiotic
            stresses like insect pests, diseases, drought, excess rainfall, and
            high wind velocity.

            <br /><br />

            <strong>2.crop plant portfolio optimization-</strong>

            crop plant portfolio of a natural farming agroecosystem should be
            optimized by applying Modern Portfolio Theory. This theory states
            that in the case of any income-generating asset portfolio,
            diversification always reduces risk and increases returns. For
            example, monoculture (1 crop) bears 100% risk, intercropping (2
            crops) bears 50% risk and polycropping of 20 crops or more bears the
            lowest level of risk. The crop portfolio is optimized for the
            uniform production of diversified crops throughout the year and the
            uniform production of pollen and nectar for the pollinators
            throughout the year.

            <br /><br />

            <strong>3.landscape design -</strong>
            while designing the landscape of a natural farming agroecosystem,
            two ecological theories should be kept in mind "the area effect on
            biodiversity" and "the edge effect on biodiversity". A larger area
            of a natural farm can accommodate a larger biodiversity of plant and
            animal species. The boundary or edge between two distinct habitats
            or ecosystems harbors more biodiversity than each of the individual
            habitats. For example, the boundary of a pond contains more
            biodiversity than either in water or the land. Therefore the
            boundaries are maximised by curving the lines of the ecotones to
            maximise the biodiversity of the agroecosystem. The position of
            different components of the farm such as green fencing, farm roads,
            ponds, fencing, hedgerow, farmhouse, farmstay, car parking, cattle
            shed, apiary, orchard, and watch tower are laid out carefully to
            build ecological niches for maximum biodiversity of animals.

            <br /><br />

            <strong>4.execution -</strong>
            while planting the trees or sowing seeds or bringing in the farm
            animals in the natural farming agroecosystem, ecological theories
            such as "ecological succession" and "carrying capacity" should be
            kept in mind to design a balanced food web and food pyramid.

            About 70% of the crops are fully or partially dependent on insect
            pollinators for biotic pollination of their flowers for fruit
            setting and to improve their fruit quality. For example, without
            pollination apple fruit setting will be hampered and fruits will be
            small and deformed. Honey bees are the best-known pollinators of
            crop plants. Native honey bee species and other native pollinator
            biodiversity are more efficient pollinators than imported exotic
            honey bees but their honey yield is less. Some crop plants, that
            provide the maximum amount of pollen and nectar to the native
            pollinator biodiversity throughout the year are called pollinator
            magnet plants. These pollinator magnet plants are included in the
            natural farming agroecosystem to maximize the incidence of native
            pollinator biodiversity and to maximize the biotic pollination of
            crops. The biodiversity of pollinator magnet plants converts the
            natural farming agroecosystem into a pollinator sanctuary or
            pollinator hotspot that serves the conservation of biodiversity.
            Honey bees also produce natural multiflora honey, a high-value
            agricultural produce. Natural farming uses native honey bee colonies
            by attracting them to the box with natural lures such as a piece of
            an old beehive or Cymbidium floribundum orchid.

            In a natural farming agroecosystem, various living organisms, namely
            plants, animals, microorganisms, and man remain interrelated with
            each other by their food relations. All these organisms occupy their
            respective trophic levels in a complex food web that maintains a
            balanced food pyramid. Green plants (autotrophs) form the base of
            the food pyramid, herbivorous animals form the second layer (primary
            consumer), carnivorous animals form the third and fourth layer
            (secondary and tertiary consumer) and the microorganisms form the
            final apex layer (detritivore) of the food pyramid. Therefore
            creation of the most effective plant biodiversity is the first
            important step in the natural farming agroecosystem. Subsequently,
            animal biodiversity (heterotrophs) are introduced within the plant
            biodiversity in tandem with the increase in the carrying capacity of
            the green plants. Animal biodiversity in the natural farming
            agroecosystem is created by man by bringing in domesticated farm
            animals as well as by allowing wild animals to occupy their
            respective ecological niches in the agroecosystem <br /><br />
            The methods include

            <br /><br />

            1. rating and ranking of animal biodiversity based on the valuation
            of their ecosystem services,

            <br /><br />

            2. selection of the best breeds of domestic animals,

            <br /><br />

            3. designing the best portfolio of domestic animals,

            <br /><br />

            4. quarantine of animals for diseases and pests,

            <br /><br />

            5. introduction of animal biodiversity in natural

            <br /><br />

            6. farming agroecosystem based on its carrying capacity (after
            deducting the amount of food harvested for man) and following the
            rules of ecosystem succession,

            <br /><br />

            7. growing the most favorite food plants of the animal biodiversity,

            <br /><br />

            8. use of poultry birds for control of insect pests and parasites of
            cattle,

            <br /><br />

            9. use of predators (such as mongoose) for control of snakes and

            <br /><br />

            10. use of medicinal plants as food for prevention of diseases in
            animals.

            Freshwater ponds are an essential component of the natural farming
            agroecosystem which provides drinking and bathing water to the
            animal biodiversity as well as provide habitat for the aquatic plant
            and animal biodiversity. These water bodies should maintain a mixed

            The products of the natural farming agroecosystems are exclusive and
            exquisite premium agricultural commodities. The existing system of
            agricultural marketing has no provision for the price discovery of
            exclusive and exquisite crops. Therefore, direct marketing is the
            only option for the farmers to sell these products directly to the
            consumers, eliminating all marketing intermediaries. Direct
            marketing can be carried out through agri-tourism, gate sales,

            The appearance of a natural farming agroecosystem resembles a
            botanical garden, a zoological garden, a biodiversity park, a
            supermarket of agricultural products, and a tourist destination.
            Farmers can monetize these cultural ecosystem services by promoting
            eco-agritourism in the natural farming agroecosystem, which can
            become one of the main sources of income for the farmers. People
            living in urban settings love to visit natural farming
            agroecosystems to experience the beauty and healing power of nature
            and biodiversity. Tourism helps with the advertising and marketing
            of natural farming products. Additional provisions for training,
            workshops, seminars, exhibitions, competitions, paintings,
            photography, meditation, naturopathy, bird watching, fishing,
            self-harvesting of fruits, self-cooking, and serving facility can
