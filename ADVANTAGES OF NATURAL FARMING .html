                    <p class="para" id="paragraph1">Natural farming is a normal business of the farmer for earning their
                        livelihood therefore, the ultimate goal of natural farming is their profit maximisation. The
                        factors that contribute to the profit maximisation of farmers are 
                        <br><br><strong>(1) minimum risk -</strong>agriculture
                        is practised in the open field therefore it faces different kinds of risks such as climate risk
                        (low or high temperature, low or high rainfall, high wind, hailstorm, lightning), biotic risk
                        (outbreak of insect pests, diseases, weeds and wild animals) and market risk (low demand, over
                        supply, low price). Crop diversification in polyculture can reduce risk and increase returns in
                        agriculture.
                        <br><br><strong>(2) Minimum cost of production - </strong>natural farming completely depends on natural
                        capital and ecosystem services for crop production and crop protection. The farmers need not
                        purchase any input from the market, hire any machine or labour for carrying out natural farming,
                        which saves huge cost,
                         <br><br><strong>(3) maximum crop yield -</strong> the aggregate crop production per year is
                        highest in natural farming. Application of advanced methods such as selection of the best
                        varieties, optimization of crop portfolio, and optimization of landscape design to maximise the
                        leaf area index can maximise the aggregate crop yield,
                        <br><br><strong>(4) maximum product diversity -</strong>  maximum
                        crop diversity, farm animal diversity and aquatic animal diversity effectively make natural
                        farming agroecosystem an agricultural supermarket with diversified product range.
                        <br><br><strong>(5) maximum product quality -</strong>  natural farming produces premium quality products through breeding of
                        exclusive and exquisite plant varieties, breeding exclusive animal breeds, selection of the best
                        plant varieties, selection of off-season or all-season varieties, elimination of chemical
                        fertilisers, growth regulators, pesticides and chemical fruit ripeners and biotic pollination of
                        crops by native pollinator biodiversity,
                        <br><br><strong>(6) maximum price of crops -</strong>  direct marketing of crops
                        gives complete liberty to the farmers to fix the price of their own crops and they tend to fix a
                        premium price for their premium products,
                        <br><br><strong>(7) regular cash flow -</strong>  crop diversification and use
                        of off-season or all-season varieties help mixed harvesting of multiple crops on a daily basis,
                        generating daily cash flow and passive income for the farmer,
                        <br><br><strong>(8) Law of increasing marginal returns -</strong>the income from the natural farming agroecosystems gradually increase over time but
                        the cost of production gradually decreases over time. As a result, income and profit increase
                        steadily. 
                        <br><br><strong>(9) Sustainability of profit margin -</strong>continuous improvement of soil health, plant
                        health, animal health, human health and agroecosystem health increase sustainability in natural
                        farming agroecosystem.
                        <br><br><strong>(10) Resilience of the agroecosystem -</strong>natural farming depends on
                        biodiversity because biodiversity imparts resilience against abiotic, biotic and financial risks
                        in agriculture.

                    Natural farming completely depends on natural capital (natural resources) and ecosystem services for
                    crop production and crop protection. The recycling of natural resources (such as water, carbon,

                    Natural farming depends on the biodiversity of organisms (plants, animals and microorganisms) to

                    Natural farming not only ensures food security of the nation but also ensures nutritional security
