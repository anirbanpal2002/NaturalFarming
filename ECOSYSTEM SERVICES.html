                    Within a natural farming agroecosystem, water moves through the atmosphere (air), biosphere (plants
                    and
                    animals), and geosphere (soil) automatically to form a complete cycle.
                    The plant biodiversity uptakes water from the soil through plant roots, releases water in the
                    atmosphere
                    through stomata in leaf surface (transpiration), induces cloud seeding, induces rainfall, harvest
                    rainwater, reduces runoff, increases infiltration of rainwater in soil, and enhances the recharge of
                    water in the underground aquifers.
                    Animals drink water from freshwater sources and get water from plants. Natural farming uses mulching
                    and
                    cover cropping to moderate soil temperature and to reduce evapotranspiration from soil surface, thus
                    maintaining the soil water level constantly at field capacity throughout the year, to enable optimum
                    growth and development of plant biodiversity.
                    There is no need to apply irrigation water to crop plants in a natural farming agroecosystem.

                    In a natural farming agroecosystem, carbon moves through the atmosphere, biosphere, and geosphere to
                    represent a complete cycle.
                    Green plants capture carbon from the atmosphere to prepare carbohydrates through photosynthesis.
                    Animals eat plants and carbon transfers from plants to animals. When plants or animals drop the
                    organic
                    matter or die, carbon compounds return to the soil.
                    Soil microorganisms decompose and mineralize these carbon compounds and make them ready for uptake
                    by
                    plants or storing the carbon in the soil.
                    On the other hand, plant and animal respiration and decomposition of organic matter release carbon
                    in
                    the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide and methane. Natural farming
                    agroecosystems aim to maximize the synthesis of organic biomass through plant biodiversity and to
                    maximize carbon capture in the soil through mulching and cover cropping, which help mitigate climate

                    Nitrogen is an inert gas in the atmosphere that passes through the atmosphere, biosphere, and
                    geosphere,
                    in the natural farming agroecosystem, to form a complete cycle.
                    During lightning in the atmosphere, nitrogen gas is oxidized to form nitrate compounds that dissolve
                    in
                    rainwater and drop on soil or plant leaves.
                    Plant leaves can absorb these nitrate compounds directly from rainwater. Plants belonging to the
                    Fabaceae family (legume crops) form symbiotic associations with Rhizobium bacteria in their root
                    nodules
                    and fix atmospheric nitrogen to form nitrate compounds.
                    Other free-living bacteria in the soil (such as Azotobacter) can also fix atmospheric nitrogen into
                    nitrogen compounds. On the other hand, denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrate or ammonia into nitrogen
                    and
                    release it into the atmosphere.
                    As nitrogen is an essential element for plant growth, natural farming explores all possible means to
                    maximize nitrogen capture from the atmosphere. Farmers maximize plant biodiversity and leaf area
                    index
                    (LAI) in the natural farming agroecosystem to harvest maximum rainwater and absorption of nitrogen
                    through plant leaves. They include legume crop biodiversity to maximise fixing of atmospheric
                    nitrogen
                    in plant roots and they use mulching and cover cropping to create congenial habitat for
                    microorganism
                    biodiversity to maximise the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen in soil, for optimum plant growth and
                    development.
