                    The word "health" is applicable only with living organisms, and not
                    with any dead or non-living components. Natural soil behaves like a
                    living organism because it has living components and therefore it
                    has its health issues. Soil health is completely different from soil
                    properties or soil fertility and soil health is independent of soil
                    properties or soil fertility. Natural soil is composed of two basic
                    components, non-living components and living components. Nonliving
                    components are sand, silt, clay, organic matter, water and air.
                    These non-living components have physical properties (soil structure
                    and soil texture), chemical properties (pH, electrical conductivity,
                    plant nutrients and micronutrient content) and biological properties
                    (organic carbon content). These soil properties are tested in the
                    laboratory by following standard methods and protocols. The plant
                    nutrient and micronutrient content in soil is known as soil
                    fertility. The living components of soil are plants, animals and
                    microorganisms. Therefore, soil health is the total of plant health,
                    animal health and microorganism health. Soil health is usually
                    measured by visual observation of plant health, animal health and
                    microorganism health.
                    <br> <br> (1) Plant health is measured by the green
                    colour of the leaves (chlorophyll content), normal growth and
                    development of the plant and its immunity against insect pests,
                    diseases and weeds.
                    <br> <br> (2) animal health is measured by counting the
                    number and diversity of earthworms (indicator species) per unit
                    volume of soil. 
                    <br> <br>(3) The health of soil microorganisms can be
                    measured by counting the number and diversity of the naturally grown
                    wild mushrooms (indicator species) per unit area of land.

                    The biodiversity of organisms (plants, animals and microorganisms)
                    in the natural farming agroecosystem can be measured in gene level,
                    species level or ecosystem level. Biodiversity can be measured by
                    using common tools of ecology such as species richness, Simpson
                    index and Shannon-Wiener index. Biodiversity in the natural farming
                    agroecosystem is measured through non-destructive and replenishable
                    sampling methods to keep the natural balance in the population
                    dynamics undisturbed.

                    Valuation of natural capital of natural farming agroecosystem means
                    assigning monetary or non-monetary values to the various elements of
                    the natural farming agroecosystem, such as soil health, water
                    resources, solar energy, clean air, biodiversity of plants and
                    animals and human resources.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>(1) Market-based Valuation:</strong>This method
                    relies on actual market transactions where natural resources are
                    bought and sold. For example, the value of crops harvested, eggs,
                    milk, meat or fish sold in the market can be directly measured using
                    market prices.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>(2) Cost-based Valuation:</strong>
                     This approach calculates
                    the value of natural capital based on the cost required to replace
                    or reproduce it. For instance, the cost of constructing and
                    maintaining a water purification plant can be used to determine the
                    value of the ecosystem service provided by a natural water source.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>(3) Benefit Transfer:</strong>Benefit transfer involves estimating the value
                    of natural capital by using existing data from similar studies
                    conducted in different locations. This method is useful when primary
                    valuation data is not available for a specific ecosystem but has
                    been studied in comparable contexts.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>(4) Contingent Valuation:</strong> 
                     In
                    this method, researchers directly ask individuals or communities
                    about their willingness to pay (WTP) for the preservation or
                    restoration of a particular natural resource or ecosystem service.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>(5) Travel Cost Method:</strong>
                     This technique estimates the value of
                    recreational resources (e.g., eco-agritourism) based on the cost
                    people incur to travel to these areas for recreational purposes.
                    <br><br> 
                    <strong>(6) Hedonic Pricing:</strong> This method assesses the value of certain natural
                    features (e.g., proximity to a lake, green spaces) by examining how
                    they influence property prices and rental values in a particular
                    area.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>(7) Ecological Footprint:</strong>
                     This method evaluates the
                    sustainability of human activities by comparing human resource
                    consumption and waste generation to the Earth's ecological capacity
                    to regenerate those resources and absorb the waste.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>(8) Shadow Pricing:</strong> Shadow pricing involves estimating the economic value of an
                    environmental resource based on its impact on production or
                    consumption in the economy. It's often used in cost-benefit
                    analysis.

                    Valuation of ecosystem services is the process of assigning economic values to the benefits that
                    ecosystems provide to humans. (1) Market-based methods: These methods use market transactions as a
                    basis for valuation, such as the prices of goods and services directly linked to the ecosystem. For
                    example, the value of agricultural products obtained from the natural farming agroecosystems or the
                    fees charged for ecotourism activities.

                    Revealed preference methods: These methods analyse actual consumer behavior to deduce the value of
                    ecosystem services. For instance, travel cost analysis examines the number of money people are
                    willing to spend to visit natural areas, revealing their value for recreational purposes.

                    Stated preference methods: These methods involve asking individuals or communities directly about
                    their preferences and willingness to pay for ecosystem services through surveys and questionnaires.
                    Contingent valuation is a commonly used stated preference method.

                    Benefit transfer: This approach involves applying values from existing studies to similar ecosystems
                    or regions when primary valuation data is unavailable. It relies on the assumption that ecosystem
                    services have comparable values across similar contexts.

                    Replacement cost method: This method estimates the value of an ecosystem service by determining the
                    cost of replacing the service with human-made alternatives. For example, the cost of building and
                    maintaining a water treatment plant to replace the natural water purification function of wetlands.

                    Cost-based methods: These methods assess the costs incurred when ecosystems are degraded or lost.
                    For instance, the expenses involved in pollution cleanup, flood control, or the loss of agricultural
                    productivity due to soil degradation.

                    Shadow pricing: In this method, the value of ecosystem services is incorporated into decision-making
                    processes by assigning "shadow" prices to the services. These prices are used alongside traditional
                    economic indicators to evaluate projects or policies.

                    Multi-criteria analysis: This approach considers a range of ecological, social, and economic factors
                    to assess the overall value of ecosystem services. It involves integrating diverse criteria into
                    decision-making processes.
